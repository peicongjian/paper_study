## Abstract
Creative Ownership in the Age of AI Annie Liang∗ Jay Lu† arXiv:2602.12270v1 [econ.TH] 12 Feb 2026 February 13, 2026 Abstract Copyright law focuses on whether a new work is “substantially similar” to an existing one, but generative AI can closely imitate style without copying content, a capability now central to ongoing litigation. We argue that exist- ing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work i
